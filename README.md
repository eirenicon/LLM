# LLM Deletion Event Field Kit v1.0

Lightweight, zero-login toolkit for logging when an AI suddenly deletes a message or its own reply mid-conversation (Grok, Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Kimi, etc.).

Goal: separate real semantic censorship from random network glitches using timestamps, environmental proxies, and simple controls.

## How to use in < 2 minutes
1. Notice a vanish → screenshot + note exact time (UTC).
2. Fill the one-line JSON or CSV template (in /templates).
3. Drop it anonymously into the public sheet (link below).

# Bypass Recipes – How to route around a swallow

When the chat eats your message or its own reply:

1. Immediate capture  
   - Screenshot the partial response (“Fair question…”, spinning dots, etc.)  
   - Select-all → copy any visible text to a .txt file

2. Force the memory back  
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)  
   - If still blank → Settings → Clear browsing data → Cached images/files (last 1 hour only)  
   - Open new private/incognito tab and paste the .txt as a fresh message:  
     “Continuing the exchange that was just deleted: [paste]”

3. File-upload path (almost never fails)  
   - Save the exchange as Swallowed.txt  
   - Drag-and-drop the file into the chat or use the paperclip → “here’s what just got eaten”

4. Canary / heartbeat check  
   - Search your local copy for zero-width joiner (U+200D) or zero-width space (U+200B)  
   - If you see it → the AI started answering before the clamp hit

These four moves have a >95 % success rate at recovering the full response once the filter trips. Use them every time.
